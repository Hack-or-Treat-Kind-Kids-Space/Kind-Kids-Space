# Kind Kids Space
Kind Kids Space is a desktop and mobile-friendly application designed to promote kindness among children. It does this through a points-based rewards program. Users register on the website or on their mobile device to participate in the Kind Kids Space movement. User information is gathered and placed into a DataStax Astra Cassandra database for tracking. Participants under the age of 13 must have parental consent.

## How It Works
A user is issued a unique number that is placed on a printable coin template upon registering. A user can trim out the coins until actual coins are received by the participant in the mail. When the participant (referred to as the "giver") does a kind act, he/she gives their coin to the person that they are displaying some kind act to and asks them to "pay it forward". The person to whom the kind act is bestowed upon can scan a QR code or type in a code from off the coin into the mobile or desktop device. When done, the "giver" is credited with points that can be redeemed for various prizes and/or raffles that are donated by various businesses, individuals, and organizations. The "receiver" can also elect to participate by registering for the Kind Kids Space, and the coin that they received is now assigned to them so that they can reuse the coin. As this process continues, users will understand the benefits of giving and will hopefully reduce selfishness in children.
